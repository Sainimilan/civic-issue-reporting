📲 Civic Issue Reporting System

A mobile-first platform that empowers citizens to report everyday civic issues like potholes, malfunctioning streetlights, or garbage overflow, while enabling local governments to track, prioritize, and resolve them through a centralized web dashboard.

🌍 Background

Local governments often struggle to promptly identify and respond to civic issues due to limited reporting mechanisms. Citizens notice these issues daily, but without an effective system to report and track them, municipal responsiveness is slow.

This project bridges that gap by providing:

A mobile app for citizens to report issues in real time.

A web dashboard for municipal staff to manage, assign, and resolve issues efficiently.

🚀 Features
Citizen Mobile App

📍 Location-based reporting – automatic GPS tagging of issues.

📸 Photo & voice uploads – give context beyond text.

🗂️ Categorization – select issue type (pothole, streetlight, garbage, etc.).

📊 Track progress – real-time updates on issue status (Pending → In Progress → Resolved).

🔔 Push notifications – stay informed at each stage.

Admin Web Dashboard

🗺️ Interactive city map – visualize issues with live markers.

🔍 Filtering & sorting – by category, location, or urgency.

🤝 Automated task routing – assign reports to the correct department.

📈 Analytics & insights – response time, trends, and reporting patterns.

⚡ Scalable backend – supports high volumes of concurrent users and multimedia uploads.
